				<p>
				    I am a Fullstack Web Developer
					based in Seattle, WA and I enjoy making vibrant and creative
					applications. 
				</p>

				<p>
					After working as a Medical Assistant for a few years, I 
					realized that I enjoyed the technical aspects over the clinical aspects of the job.
                    This inspired me to make the move to Tech, I enrolled into Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program and learned the fundamentals or Fullstack JavaScript programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the immersion program, I gained experience building full stack applications that where regulated in a test-driven environment as well as working in teams and collaborating.
				</p>
				<p>
					With my experience in the medical field, Iâ€™m passionate about
					building products that touch the lives of others. I've helped
					doctors/providers deliver great patient care. Now, I want to build web
					applications that allow users to be better.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am open to collaboration, employment opportunities, or questions about my journey so far.
					
				</p>

				<p>
					Outside of programming, I love practicing yoga, painting, singing,
					and dancing.

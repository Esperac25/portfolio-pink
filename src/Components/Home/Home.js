				    I am a Fullstack Web Developer
					based in Seattle, WA and I enjoy making vibrant and creative
					applications.
				</p>

				<p>
					After working as a Medical Assistant for a few years, I 
					realized that I enjoyed the technical aspects over the clinical aspects of the job.
                    This inspired me to make the move to Tech.
				</p>

				<p>
					With my experience in the medical field, Iâ€™m passionate about
					building products that touch the lives of others. I've helped
					doctors/providers deliver great patient care. Now, I want to build web
					applications that allow users to be better.
				</p>

				<p>
					Outside of programming, I love practicing yoga, painting, singing,
					and dancing.
